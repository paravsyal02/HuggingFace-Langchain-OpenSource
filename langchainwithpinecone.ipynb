This is the first Budget in Amrit \\nKaal. \\nIntroduction \\n1. This Budget hopes to build on the foundation laid in the previous \\nBudget, and the blueprint drawn for India@100. We envision a prosperous \\nand inclusive India, in which the fruits of development reach all regions and \\ncitizens, especially our youth, women, farmers, OBCs, Scheduled Castes and \\nScheduled Tribes.  \\n2. In the 75 th year of our Independence, the world has recognised the \\nIndian economy as a ‘bright star’. Our current year’s economic growth is \\nestimated to be at 7 per cent. It is notable that this is the highest among all \\nthe major economies. This is in spite of the massive slowdown globally \\ncaused by Covid-19 and a war. The Indian economy is therefore on the right \\ntrack, and despite a time of challenges, heading towards a bright future.  \\n3. Today as Indians stands with their head held high, and the world \\nappreciates India’s achievements and successes, we are sure that elders \\nwho had fought for India’s independence, will with joy, bless us our \\nendeavors going forward. \\nResilience amidst multiple crises \\n4. Our focus on wide-ranging reforms and sound policies, implemented \\nthrough Sabka Prayas  resulting in Jan Bhagidari  and targeted support to \\nthose in need, helped us perform well in trying times. India’s rising global '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Budget_Speech.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='2 \\n \\n \\n \\nprofile is because of several accomplishments: unique world class digital \\npublic infrastructure, e.g., Aadhaar, Co-Win and UPI; Covid vaccination drive \\nin unparalleled scale and speed; proactive role in frontier areas such as \\nachieving the climate related goals, mission LiFE, and National Hydrogen \\nMission.  \\n5. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we ensured that no one goes to bed \\nhungry, with a scheme to supply free food grains to over 80 crore persons \\nfor 28 months. Continuing our commitment to ensure food and nutritional \\nsecurity, we are implementing, from 1st January 2023, a scheme to supply \\nfree food grain to all Antyodaya and priority households for the next one \\nyear, under PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY). The entire \\nexpenditure of about ` 2 lakh crore will be borne by the Central \\nGovernment. \\nG20 Presidency: Steering the global agenda through challenges \\n6. In these times of global challenges, the G20 Presidency gives us a \\nunique opportunity to strengthen India’s role in the world economic order. \\nWith the theme of ‘ Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ , we are steering an \\nambitious, people-centric agenda to address global challenges, and to \\nfacilitate sustainable economic development.  \\nAchievements since 2014: Leaving no one behind \\n7. The government’s efforts since 2014 have ensured for all citizens a \\nbetter quality of living and a life of dignity. The per capita income has more \\nthan doubled to ` 1.97 lakh.   \\n8. In these nine years, the Indian economy has increased in size from \\nbeing 10th to 5 th largest in the world. We have significantly improved our \\nposition as a well-governed and innovative country with a conducive \\nenvironment for business as reflected in several global indices. We have \\nmade significant progress in many Sustainable Development Goals.  '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Budget_Speech.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='3 \\n \\n \\n \\n9. The economy has become a lot more formalised as reflected in the \\nEPFO membership more than doubling to 27 crore, and 7,400 crore digital \\npayments of ` 126 lakh crore through UPI in 2022.    \\n10. The efficient implementation of many schemes, with \\nuniversalisation of targeted benefits, has resulted in inclusive development. \\nSome of the schemes are: \\ni. 11.7 crore household toilets under Swachh Bharat Mission,  \\nii. 9.6 crore LPG connections under Ujjawala,  \\niii. 220 crore Covid vaccination of 102 crore persons,    \\niv. 47.8 crore PM Jan Dhan bank accounts, \\nv. Insurance cover for 44.6 crore persons under PM Suraksha \\nBima and PM Jeevan Jyoti Yojana, and \\nvi. Cash transfer of ` 2.2 lakh crore to over 11.4 crore farmers \\nunder PM Kisan Samman Nidhi. \\nVision for Amrit Kaal – an empowered and inclusive economy \\n11. Our vision for the Amrit Kaal  includes technology-driven and \\nknowledge-based economy with strong public finances, and a robust \\nfinancial sector. To achieve this, Jan Bhagidari through Sabka Saath Sabka \\nPrayas is essential.   \\n12. The economic agenda for achieving this vision focuses on three \\nthings: first, facilitating ample opportunities for citizens, especially the \\nyouth, to fulfil their aspirations; second, providing strong impetus to growth \\nand job creation; and third, strengthening macro-economic stability.    \\n13. To service these focus areas in our journey to India@100, we believe \\nthat the following four opportunities can be transformative during Amrit \\nKaal.  '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Budget_Speech.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='4 \\n \\n \\n \\n1) Economic Empowerment of Women : Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana \\nNational Rural Livelihood Mission has achieved remarkable success \\nby mobilizing rural women into 81 lakh Self Help Groups. We will \\nenable these groups to reach the next stage of economic \\nempowerment through formation of large producer enterprises or \\ncollectives with each having several thousand members and \\nmanaged professionally. They will be helped with supply of raw \\nmaterials and for better design, quality, branding and marketing of \\ntheir products. Through supporting policies, they will be enabled to \\nscale up their operations to serve the large consumer markets, as \\nhas been the case with several start-ups growing into ‘Unicorns’. \\n2) PM VIshwakarma KAushal Samman (PM VIKAS) : For centuries, \\ntraditional artisans and craftspeople, who work with their hands \\nusing tools, have brought renown for India. They are generally \\nreferred to as Vishwakarma. The art and handicraft created by them \\nrepresents the true spirit of Atmanirbhar Bharat. For the first time, a \\npackage of assistance for them has been conceptualized. The new \\nscheme will enable them to improve the quality, scale and reach of \\ntheir products, integrating them with the MSME value chain. The \\ncomponents of the scheme will include not only financial support \\nbut also access to advanced skill training, knowledge of modern \\ndigital techniques and efficient green technologies, brand \\npromotion, linkage with local and global markets, digital payments, \\nand social security. This will greatly benefit the Scheduled Castes, \\nScheduled Tribes, OBCs, women and people belonging to the weaker \\nsections.  \\n3) Tourism: The country offers immense attraction for domestic as well \\nas foreign tourists. There is a large potential to be tapped in tourism. \\nThe sector holds huge opportunities for jobs and entrepreneurship \\nfor youth in particular.  Promotion of tourism will be taken up on \\nmission mode, with active participation of states, convergence of \\ngovernment programmes and public-private partnerships. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Budget_Speech.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='5 \\n \\n \\n \\n4) Green Growth: We are implementing many programmes for green \\nfuel, green energy, green farming, green mobility, green buildings, \\nand green equipment, and policies for efficient use of energy across \\nvarious economic sectors. These green growth efforts help in \\nreducing carbon intensity of the economy and provides for large-\\nscale green job opportunities.  \\nPriorities of this Budget \\n14. The Budget adopts the following seven priorities. They complement \\neach other and act as the ‘Saptarishi’ guiding us through the Amrit Kaal. \\n1) Inclusive Development  \\n2) Reaching the Last Mile \\n3) Infrastructure and Investment \\n4) Unleashing the Potential \\n5) Green Growth \\n6) Youth Power  \\n7) Financial Sector \\nPriority 1: Inclusive Development  \\n15. The Government’s philosophy of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas  has \\nfacilitated inclusive development covering in specific, farmers, women, \\nyouth, OBCs, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, divyangjan and \\neconomically weaker sections, and overall priority for the underprivileged \\n(vanchiton ko variyata). There has also been a sustained focus on Jammu & \\nKashmir, Ladakh and the North-East. This Budget builds on those efforts.  \\nAgriculture and Cooperation   \\nDigital Public Infrastructure for Agriculture \\n16. Digital public infrastructure for agriculture will be built as an open \\nsource, open standard and inter operable public good. This will enable '),\n",

An Agriculture Accelerator Fund will be set-up to encourage agri-\\nstartups by young entrepreneurs in rural areas. The Fund will aim at \\nbringing innovative and affordable solutions for challenges faced by \\nfarmers. It will also bring in modern technologies to transform agricultural \\npractices, increase productivity and profitability. \\nEnhancing productivity of cotton crop  \\n18. To enhance the productivity of extra-long staple cotton, we will \\nadopt a cluster-based and value chain approach through Public Private \\nPartnerships (PPP). This will mean collaboration between farmers, state and \\nindustry for input supplies, extension services, and market linkages. \\nAtmanirbhar Horticulture Clean Plant Program  \\n19. We will launch an Atmanirbhar Clean Plant Program to boost \\navailability of disease-free, quality planting material for high value \\nhorticultural crops at an outlay of ` 2,200 crore. \\nGlobal Hub for Millets: ‘Shree Anna’ \\n20. “India is at the forefront of popularizing Millets, whose consumption \\nfurthers nutrition, food security and welfare of farmers,” said Hon’ble Prime \\nMinister. \\n21.  We are the largest producer and second largest exporter of ‘Shree \\nAnna’ in the world. We grow several types of ' Shree Anna'  such as  jowar, \\nragi, bajra, kuttu, ramdana, kangni, kutki, kodo, cheena, and sama. These \\nhave a number of health benefits, and have been an integral part of our \\nfood for centuries. I acknowledge with pride the huge service done by small \"),\n",

Now to make India a global hub for ' Shree Anna', the Indian Institute \\nof Millet Research, Hyderabad will be supported as the Centre of Excellence \\nfor sharing best practices, research and technologies at the international \\nlevel.    \\nAgriculture Credit  \\n23. The agriculture credit target will be increased  \\nto ` 20 lakh crore with focus on animal husbandry, dairy and fisheries.  \\nFisheries \\n24. We will launch a new sub-scheme of PM Matsya Sampada Yojana \\nwith targeted investment of ` 6,000 crore to further enable activities of \\nfishermen, fish vendors, and micro & small enterprises, improve value chain \\nefficiencies, and expand the market. \\nCooperation \\n25. For farmers, especially small and marginal farmers, and other \\nmarginalised sections, the government is promoting cooperative-based \\neconomic development model. A new Ministry of Cooperation was formed \\nwith a mandate to realise the vision of ‘Sahakar Se Samriddhi’. To realise \\nthis vision, the government has already initiated computerisation of 63,000 \\nPrimary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) with an investment of ` 2,516 \\ncrore. In consultation with all stakeholders and states, model bye-laws for \\nPACS were formulated enabling them to become multipurpose PACS. A \\nnational cooperative database is being prepared for country-wide mapping \\nof cooperative societies.  \\n26. With this backdrop, we will implement a plan to set up massive \\ndecentralised storage capacity. This will help farmers store their produce \\nand realize remunerative prices through sale at appropriate times.

A new programme to promote research and innovation in \\npharmaceuticals will be taken up through centers of excellence. We shall \\nalso encourage industry to invest in research and development in specific \\npriority areas.  \\nMultidisciplinary courses for medical devices \\n31. Dedicated multidisciplinary courses for medical devices will be \\nsupported in existing institutions to ensure availability of skilled manpower \\nfor futuristic medical technologies, high-end manufacturing and research.   \\n '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Budget_Speech.pdf', 'page': 12}, page_content='9 \\n \\n \\n \\nTeachers’ Training \\n32. Teachers’ training will be re-envisioned through innovative \\npedagogy, curriculum transaction, continuous professional development, \\ndipstick surveys, and ICT implementation. The District Institutes of \\nEducation and Training will be developed as vibrant institutes of excellence \\nfor this purpose.   \\nNational Digital Library for Children and Adolescents  \\n33. A National Digital Library for children and adolescents  will be set-up \\nfor facilitating availability of quality books across geographies, languages, \\ngenres and levels, and device agnostic accessibility. States will be \\nencouraged to set up physical libraries for them at panchayat and ward \\nlevels and provide infrastructure for accessing the National Digital Library \\nresources. \\n34. Additionally, to build a culture of reading, and to make up for \\npandemic-time learning loss, the National Book Trust, Children’s Book Trust \\nand other sources will be encouraged to provide and replenish non-\\ncurricular titles in regional languages and English to these physical libraries. \\nCollaboration with NGOs that work in literacy will also be a part of this \\ninitiative. To inculcate financial literacy, financial sector regulators and \\norganizations will be encouraged to provide age-appropriate reading \\nmaterial to these libraries.  \\nPriority 2: Reaching the Last Mile \\n35. Prime Minister Vajpayee’s government had formed the Ministry of \\nTribal Affairs and the Department of Development of North-Eastern Region. \\nTo provide a sharper focus to the objective of ‘reaching the last mile’, our \\ngovernment has formed the ministries of AYUSH, Fisheries, Animal \\nHusbandry and Dairying, Skill Development, Jal Shakti and Cooperation.  \\n \\n '),\n",

Building on the success of the Aspirational Districts Programme, the \\nGovernment has recently launched the Aspirational Blocks Programme \\ncovering 500 blocks for saturation of essential government services across \\nmultiple domains such as health, nutrition, education, agriculture, water \\nresources, financial inclusion, skill development, and basic infrastructure. \\nPradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission \\n37. To improve socio-economic conditions of the particularly vulnerable \\ntribal groups (PVTGs), Pradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission will be \\nlaunched. This will saturate PVTG families and habitations with basic \\nfacilities such as safe housing, clean drinking water and sanitation, \\nimproved access to education, health and nutrition, road and telecom \\nconnectivity, and sustainable livelihood opportunities. An amount  \\nof ` 15,000 crore will be made available to implement the Mission in the \\nnext three years under the Development Action Plan for the Scheduled \\nTribes.  \\nEklavya Model Residential Schools \\n38. In the next three years, centre will recruit 38,800 teachers and \\nsupport staff for the 740 Eklavya Model Residential Schools, serving 3.5 lakh \\ntribal students. \\nWater for Drought Prone Region \\n39. In the drought prone central region of Karnataka, central assistance \\nof ` 5,300 crore will be given to Upper Bhadra Project to provide \\nsustainable micro irrigation and filling up of surface tanks for drinking \\nwater.  \\nPM Awas Yojana \\n40.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Budget_Speech.pdf', 'page': 14}, page_content='11 \\n \\n \\n \\nBharat Shared Repository of Inscriptions (Bharat SHRI) \\n41. ‘Bharat Shared Repository of Inscriptions’ will be set up in a digital \\nepigraphy museum, with digitization of one lakh ancient inscriptions in the \\nfirst stage.   \\nSupport for poor prisoners \\n42. For poor persons who are in prisons and unable to afford the \\npenalty or the bail amount, required financial support will be provided.   \\n \\nPriority 3: Infrastructure & Investment \\n43. Investments in Infrastructure and productive capacity have a large \\nmultiplier impact on growth and employment. After the subdued period of \\nthe pandemic, private investments are growing again. The Budget takes the \\nlead once again to ramp up the virtuous cycle of investment and job \\ncreation.    \\n \\nCapital Investment as driver of growth and jobs \\n44. Capital investment outlay is being increased steeply for the third \\nyear in a row by 33 per cent to ` 10 lakh crore, which would be 3.3 per cent \\nof GDP. This will be almost three times the outlay in 2019-20.   \\n45. This substantial increase in recent years is central to the \\ngovernment’s efforts to enhance growth potential and job creation, crowd-\\nin private investments, and provide a cushion against global headwinds. \\nEffective Capital Expenditure  \\n46. The direct capital investment by the Centre is complemented by the \\nprovision made for creation of capital assets through Grants-in-Aid to \\nStates. The ‘Effective Capital Expenditure’ of the Centre is budgeted at  \\n` 13.7 lakh crore, which will be 4.5 per cent of GDP.    '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Budget_Speech.pdf', 'page': 15}, page_content='12 \\n \\n \\n \\nSupport to State Governments for Capital Investment \\n47. I have decided to continue the 50-year interest free loan to state \\ngovernments for one more year to spur investment in infrastructure and to \\nincentivize them for complementary policy actions, with a significantly \\nenhanced outlay of ` 1.3 lakh crore.   \\nEnhancing opportunities for private investment in Infrastructure \\n48. The newly established Infrastructure Finance Secretariat will assist \\nall stakeholders for more private investment in infrastructure, including \\nrailways, roads, urban infrastructure and power, which are predominantly \\ndependent on public resources.  \\nHarmonized Master List of Infrastructure \\n49. The Harmonized Master List of Infrastructure will be reviewed by an \\nexpert committee for recommending the classification and financing \\nframework suitable for Amrit Kaal. \\nRailways \\n50. A capital outlay of ` 2.40 lakh crore has been provided for the \\nRailways. This highest ever outlay is about 9 times the outlay made in 2013-\\n14.  \\nLogistics \\n51. One hundred critical transport infrastructure projects, for last and \\nfirst mile connectivity for ports, coal, steel, fertilizer, and food grains sectors \\nhave been identified. They will be taken up on priority with investment of \\n` 75,000 crore, including ` 15,000 crore from private sources. \\nRegional Connectivity \\n52. Fifty additional airports, heliports, water aerodromes and advance \\nlanding grounds will be revived for improving regional air connectivity.  \\n '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Budget_Speech.pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content='13 \\n \\n \\n \\nSustainable Cities of Tomorrow \\n53. States and cities will be encouraged to undertake urban planning \\nreforms and actions to transform our cities into ‘sustainable cities of \\ntomorrow’. This means efficient use of land resources, adequate resources \\nfor urban infrastructure, transit-oriented development, enhanced \\navailability and affordability of urban land, and opportunities for all.  \\nMaking Cities ready for Municipal Bonds \\n54. Through property tax governance reforms and ring-fencing user \\ncharges on urban infrastructure, cities will be incentivized to improve their \\ncredit worthiness for municipal bonds.   \\nUrban Infrastructure Development Fund  \\n55. Like the RIDF, an Urban Infrastructure Development Fund (UIDF) will \\nbe established through use of priority sector lending shortfall. This will be \\nmanaged by the National Housing Bank, and will be used by public agencies \\nto create urban infrastructure in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. States will be \\nencouraged to leverage resources from the grants of the 15 th Finance \\nCommission, as well as existing schemes, to adopt appropriate user charges \\nwhile accessing the UIDF. We expect to make  \\navailable ` 10,000 crore per annum for this purpose. \\nUrban Sanitation \\n56. All cities and towns will be enabled for 100 per cent mechanical \\ndesludging of septic tanks and sewers to transition from manhole to \\nmachine-hole mode. Enhanced focus will be provided for scientific \\nmanagement of dry and wet waste. \\nPriority 4: Unleashing the Potential \\n57. “Good Governance is the key to a nation’s progress. Our government \\nis committed to providing a transparent and accountable administration \\nwhich works for the betterment and welfare of the common citizen,”  said \\nHon’ble Prime Minister. '),\n",

For enhancing ease of doing business, more than  \\n39,000 compliances have been reduced and more than  \\n3,400 legal provisions have been decriminalized. For furthering the trust-\\nbased governance, we have introduced the Jan Vishwas Bill to amend 42 \\nCentral Acts. This Budget proposes a series of measures to unleash the \\npotential of our economy.  \\nCentres of Excellence for Artificial Intelligence \\n60. For realizing the vision of “Make AI in India and Make AI work for \\nIndia”, three centres of excellence for Artificial Intelligence will be set-up in \\ntop educational institutions. Leading industry players will partner in \\nconducting interdisciplinary research, develop cutting-edge applications and \\nscalable problem solutions in the areas of agriculture, health, and \\nsustainable cities. This will galvanize an effective AI ecosystem and nurture \\nquality human resources in the field. \\nNational Data Governance Policy \\n61. To unleash innovation and research by start-ups and academia, a \\nNational Data Governance Policy will be brought out. This will enable access \\nto anonymized data. \\nSimplification of Know Your Customer (KYC) process  \\n62. The KYC process will be simplified adopting a ‘risk-based’ instead of \\n‘one size fits all’ approach. The financial sector regulators will also be '),\n",

A one stop solution for reconciliation and updating of identity and \\naddress of individuals maintained by various government agencies, \\nregulators and regulated entities will be established using DigiLocker service \\nand Aadhaar as foundational identity.    \\nCommon Business Identifier   \\n64. For the business establishments required to have a Permanent \\nAccount Number (PAN), the PAN will be used as the common identifier for \\nall digital systems of specified government agencies. This will bring ease of \\ndoing business; and it will be facilitated through a legal mandate. \\nUnified Filing Process \\n65. For obviating the need for separate submission of same information \\nto different government agencies, a system of ‘Unified Filing Process’ will be \\nset-up. Such filing of information or return in simplified forms on a common \\nportal, will be shared with other agencies as per filer’s choice.  \\nVivad se Vishwas I – Relief for MSMEs  \\n66. In cases of failure by MSMEs to execute contracts during the Covid \\nperiod, 95 per cent of the forfeited amount relating to bid or performance \\nsecurity, will be returned to them by government and government \\nundertakings.  This will provide relief to MSMEs.  \\nVivad se Vishwas II – Settling Contractual Disputes  \\n67.

My indirect tax proposals aim to promote exports, boost domestic \\nmanufacturing, enhance domestic value addition, encourage green energy \\nand mobility.  \\n119. A simplified tax structure with fewer tax rates helps in reducing \\ncompliance burden and improving tax administration. I propose to reduce \\nthe number of basic customs duty rates on goods, other than textiles and \\nagriculture, from 21 to 13. As a result, there are minor changes in the basic \\ncustom duties, cesses and surcharges on some items including toys, \\nbicycles, automobiles and naphtha. \\n \\nGreen Mobility \\n120. To avoid cascading of taxes on blended compressed natural gas, I \\npropose to exempt excise duty on GST-paid compressed bio gas contained \\nin it. To further provide impetus to green mobility, customs duty exemption \\nis being extended to import of capital goods and machinery required for \\nmanufacture of lithium-ion cells for batteries used in electric vehicles. \\nElectronics  \\n121. As a result of various initiatives of the Government, including the \\nPhased Manufacturing programme, mobile phone production in India has \\nincreased from 5.8 crore units valued at about ` 18,900 crore in 2014-15 to \\n31 crore units valued at over ` 2,75,000 crore in the last financial year.

To rectify inversion of duty structure and encourage manufacturing \\nof electric kitchen chimneys, the basic customs duty on electric kitchen \\nchimney is being increased from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent and that on \\nheat coils for these is proposed to be reduced from 20 per cent to 15 per \\ncent. \\nChemicals and Petrochemicals  \\n124. Denatured ethyl alcohol is used in chemical industry. \\n I propose to exempt basic customs duty on it.

Basic customs duty is also being reduced on acid grade fluorspar \\nfrom 5 per cent to 2.5 per cent to make the domestic fluorochemicals \\nindustry competitive. Further, the basic customs duty on crude glycerin for \\nuse in manufacture of epicholorhydrin is proposed to be reduced from 7.5 \\nper cent to 2.5 per cent. \\nMarine products \\n125.

It has been the constant endeavour of the Income Tax Department \\nto improve Tax Payers Services by making compliance easy and smooth. Our \\ntax payers’ portal received a maximum of 72 lakh returns in a day; \\nprocessed more than 6.5 crore returns this year; average processing period \\nreduced from 93 days in financial year 13-14 to 16 days now;  \\nand 45 per cent of the returns were processed within 24 hours. We intend \\nto further improve this, roll out a next-generation Common IT Return Form \\nfor tax payer convenience, and also plan to strengthen the grievance \\nredressal mechanism.  \\nMSMEs and Professionals  \\n134. MSMEs are growth engines of our economy.  Micro enterprises with \\nturnover up to ` 2 crore and certain professionals with turnover of up to  \\n` 50 lakh can avail the benefit of presumptive taxation. I propose to provide \\nenhanced limits of ` 3 crore and ` 75 lakh respectively, to the tax payers \\nwhose cash receipts are no more than 5 per cent. Moreover, to support \\nMSMEs in timely receipt of payments, I propose to allow deduction for \\nexpenditure incurred on payments made to them only when payment is \\nactually made.  \\nCooperation \\n135. Cooperation is a value to be cherished. In realizing our Prime \\nMinister’s goal of “Sahkar se Samriddhi ”, and his resolve to “connect the \\nspirit of cooperation with the spirit of Amrit Kaal”, in addition to the \\nmeasures proposed in Part A, I have a slew of proposals for the co-operative \\nsector.

First, new co-operatives that commence manufacturing activities till \\n31.3.2024 shall get the benefit of a lower tax rate of 15 per cent, as is \\npresently available to new manufacturing companies. \\n137. Secondly, I propose to provide an opportunity to sugar co-operatives \\nto claim payments made to sugarcane farmers for the period prior to \\nassessment year 2016-17 as expenditure. This is expected to provide them \\nwith a relief of almost ` 10,000 crore.  \\n138. Thirdly, I am providing a higher limit of ` 2 lakh per member for cash \\ndeposits to and loans in cash by Primary Agricultural Co-operative Societies \\n(PACS) and Primary Co-operative Agriculture and Rural Development Banks \\n(PCARDBs).  \\n139. Similarly, a higher limit of ` 3 crore for TDS on cash withdrawal is \\nbeing provided to co-operative societies. \\nStart-Ups \\n140. Entrepreneurship is vital for a country’s economic development. We \\nhave taken a number of measures for start-ups and they have borne results. \\nIndia is now the third largest ecosystem for start-ups globally, and ranks \\nsecond in innovation quality among middle-income countries. I propose to \\nextend the date of incorporation for income tax benefits to start-ups from \\n31.03.23 to 31.3.24. I further propose to provide the benefit of carry \\nforward of losses on change of shareholding of start-ups from seven years \\nof incorporation to ten years. \\nAppeals \\n141. To reduce the pendency of appeals at Commissioner level, I propose \\nto deploy about 100 Joint Commissioners for disposal of small appeals.

For better targeting of tax concessions and exemptions, \\n I propose to cap deduction from capital gains on investment in residential \\nhouse under sections 54 and 54F to ` 10 crore. Another proposal with \\nsimilar intent is to limit income tax exemption from proceeds of insurance \\npolicies with very high value. \\nRationalisation \\n143.

Income of authorities, boards and commissions set up by \\nstatutes of the Union or State for the purpose of housing, development of \\ncities, towns and villages, and regulating, or regulating and developing an \\nactivity or matter, is proposed to be exempted from income tax.

Now, I come to what everyone is waiting for -- personal income tax. I \\nhave five major announcements to make in this regard. These primarily \\nbenefit our hard-working middle class. \\n146. The first one concerns rebate. Currently, those with income up to  \\n` 5 lakh do not pay any income tax in both old and new tax regimes. I \\npropose to increase the rebate limit to ` 7 lakh in the new tax regime. Thus, \\npersons in the new tax regime, with income up to ` 7 lakh will not have to \\npay any tax.  \\n147. The second proposal relates to middle-class individuals. \\n I had introduced, in the year 2020, the new personal income tax regime \\nwith six income slabs starting from ` 2.5 lakh. I propose to change the tax \\nstructure in this regime by reducing the number of slabs to five and \\nincreasing the tax exemption limit to ` 3 lakh. The new tax rates are: \\n` 0-3 lakh Nil \\n` 3-6 lakh 5 per cent \\n` 6-9 lakh 10 per cent \\n` 9-12 lakh 15 per cent \\n` 12-15 lakh 20 per cent \\nAbove ` 15 lakh 30 per cent \\n \\n148. This will provide major relief to all tax payers in the new regime. An \\nindividual with an annual income of ` 9 lakh will be required to pay only  \\n` 45,000/-. This is only 5 per cent of his or her income. It is a reduction of 25 \\nper cent on what he or she is required to pay now, ie, ` 60,000/-.

My fourth announcement in personal income tax is regarding the \\nhighest tax rate which in our country is 42.74 per cent. This is among the \\nhighest in the world. I propose to reduce the highest surcharge rate from 37 \\nper cent to 25 per cent in the new tax regime. This would result in reduction \\nof the maximum tax rate to 39 per cent. \\n151. Lastly, the limit of ` 3 lakh for tax exemption on leave encashment \\non retirement of non-government salaried employees was last fixed in the \\nyear 2002, when the highest basic pay in the government was ` 30,000/- \\npm. In line with the increase in government salaries, I am proposing to \\nincrease this limit to ` 25 lakh. \\n152. We are also making the new income tax regime as the default tax \\nregime. However, citizens will continue to have the option to avail the \\nbenefit of the old tax regime. \\n153. Apart from these, I am also making some other changes as given in \\nthe annexure. \\n154. As a result of these proposals, revenue of about ` 38,000 crore –  \\n` 37,000 crore in direct taxes and ` 1,000 crore in indirect taxes – will be \\nforgone while revenue of about ` 3,000 crore will be additionally mobilized. \\nThus, the total revenue forgone is about ` 35,000 crore annually. \\n155.

This is the first Budget in Amrit \\nKaal. \\nIntroduction \\n1. This Budget hopes to build on the foundation laid in the previous \\nBudget, and the blueprint drawn for India@100. We envision a prosperous \\nand inclusive India, in which the fruits of development reach all regions and \\ncitizens, especially our youth, women, farmers, OBCs, Scheduled Castes and \\nScheduled Tribes.  \\n2. In the 75 th year of our Independence, the world has recognised the \\nIndian economy as a ‘bright star’. Our current year’s economic growth is \\nestimated to be at 7 per cent. It is notable that this is the highest among all \\nthe major economies. This is in spite of the massive slowdown globally \\ncaused by Covid-19 and a war. The Indian economy is therefore on the right \\ntrack, and despite a time of challenges, heading towards a bright future.  \\n3. Today as Indians stands with their head held high, and the world \\nappreciates India’s achievements and successes, we are sure that elders \\nwho had fought for India’s independence, will with joy, bless us our \\nendeavors going forward. \\nResilience amidst multiple crises \\n4. Our focus on wide-ranging reforms and sound policies, implemented \\nthrough Sabka Prayas  resulting in Jan Bhagidari  and targeted support to \\nthose in need, helped us perform well in trying times. India’s rising global'),\n",

During the Covid-19 pandemic, we ensured that no one goes to bed \\nhungry, with a scheme to supply free food grains to over 80 crore persons \\nfor 28 months. Continuing our commitment to ensure food and nutritional \\nsecurity, we are implementing, from 1st January 2023, a scheme to supply \\nfree food grain to all Antyodaya and priority households for the next one \\nyear, under PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY). The entire \\nexpenditure of about ` 2 lakh crore will be borne by the Central \\nGovernment. \\nG20 Presidency: Steering the global agenda through challenges \\n6. In these times of global challenges, the G20 Presidency gives us a \\nunique opportunity to strengthen India’s role in the world economic order. \\nWith the theme of ‘ Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ , we are steering an \\nambitious, people-centric agenda to address global challenges, and to \\nfacilitate sustainable economic development.  \\nAchievements since 2014: Leaving no one behind \\n7. The government’s efforts since 2014 have ensured for all citizens a \\nbetter quality of living and a life of dignity. The per capita income has more \\nthan doubled to ` 1.97 lakh.   \\n8.

The economy has become a lot more formalised as reflected in the \\nEPFO membership more than doubling to 27 crore, and 7,400 crore digital \\npayments of ` 126 lakh crore through UPI in 2022.    \\n10. The efficient implementation of many schemes, with \\nuniversalisation of targeted benefits, has resulted in inclusive development. \\nSome of the schemes are: \\ni. 11.7 crore household toilets under Swachh Bharat Mission,  \\nii. 9.6 crore LPG connections under Ujjawala,  \\niii. 220 crore Covid vaccination of 102 crore persons,    \\niv. 47.8 crore PM Jan Dhan bank accounts, \\nv.

Our vision for the Amrit Kaal  includes technology-driven and \\nknowledge-based economy with strong public finances, and a robust \\nfinancial sector. To achieve this, Jan Bhagidari through Sabka Saath Sabka \\nPrayas is essential.   \\n12. The economic agenda for achieving this vision focuses on three \\nthings: first, facilitating ample opportunities for citizens, especially the \\nyouth, to fulfil their aspirations; second, providing strong impetus to growth \\nand job creation; and third, strengthening macro-economic stability.    \\n13.

My indirect tax proposals aim to promote exports, boost domestic \\nmanufacturing, enhance domestic value addition, encourage green energy \\nand mobility.  \\n119. A simplified tax structure with fewer tax rates helps in reducing \\ncompliance burden and improving tax administration. I propose to reduce \\nthe number of basic customs duty rates on goods, other than textiles and \\nagriculture, from 21 to 13. As a result, there are minor changes in the basic \\ncustom duties, cesses and surcharges on some items including toys, \\nbicycles, automobiles and naphtha. \\n \\nGreen Mobility \\n120. To avoid cascading of taxes on blended compressed natural gas, I \\npropose to exempt excise duty on GST-paid compressed bio gas contained \\nin it. To further provide impetus to green mobility, customs duty exemption \\nis being extended to import of capital goods and machinery required for \\nmanufacture of lithium-ion cells for batteries used in electric vehicles. \\nElectronics  \\n121. As a result of various initiatives of the Government, including the \\nPhased Manufacturing programme, mobile phone production in India has \\nincreased from 5.8 crore units valued at about ` 18,900 crore in 2014-15 to \\n31 crore units valued at over ` 2,75,000 crore in the last financial year.

Now, I come to what everyone is waiting for -- personal income tax. I \\nhave five major announcements to make in this regard. These primarily \\nbenefit our hard-working middle class. \\n146. The first one concerns rebate. Currently, those with income up to  \\n` 5 lakh do not pay any income tax in both old and new tax regimes. I \\npropose to increase the rebate limit to ` 7 lakh in the new tax regime. Thus, \\npersons in the new tax regime, with income up to ` 7 lakh will not have to \\npay any tax.  \\n147. The second proposal relates to middle-class individuals. \\n I had introduced, in the year 2020, the new personal income tax regime \\nwith six income slabs starting from ` 2.5 lakh. I propose to change the tax \\nstructure in this regime by reducing the number of slabs to five and \\nincreasing the tax exemption limit to ` 3 lakh. The new tax rates are: \\n` 0-3 lakh Nil \\n` 3-6 lakh 5 per cent \\n` 6-9 lakh 10 per cent \\n` 9-12 lakh 15 per cent \\n` 12-15 lakh 20 per cent \\nAbove ` 15 lakh 30 per cent \\n \\n148. This will provide major relief to all tax payers in the new regime. An \\nindividual with an annual income of ` 9 lakh will be required to pay only  \\n` 45,000/-. This is only 5 per cent of his or her income. It is a reduction of 25 \\nper cent on what he or she is required to pay now, ie, ` 60,000/-. Similarly, \\nan individual with an income of ` 15 lakh would be required to pay only  \\n` 1.5 lakh or 10 per cent of his or her income, a reduction of 20 per cent \\nfrom the existing liability of ` 1,87,500/.'),\n",

I propose to reduce the highest surcharge rate from 37 \\nper cent to 25 per cent in the new tax regime. This would result in reduction \\nof the maximum tax rate to 39 per cent. \\n151. Lastly, the limit of ` 3 lakh for tax exemption on leave encashment \\non retirement of non-government salaried employees was last fixed in the \\nyear 2002, when the highest basic pay in the government was ` 30,000/- \\npm. In line with the increase in government salaries, I am proposing to \\nincrease this limit to ` 25 lakh. \\n152. We are also making the new income tax regime as the default tax \\nregime.

In the 75 th year of our Independence, the world has recognised the \\nIndian economy as a ‘bright star’. Our current year’s economic growth is \\nestimated to be at 7 per cent. It is notable that this is the highest among all \\nthe major economies. This is in spite of the massive slowdown globally \\ncaused by Covid-19 and a war. The Indian economy is therefore on the right \\ntrack, and despite a time of challenges, heading towards a bright future.  \\n3. Today as Indians stands with their head held high, and the world \\nappreciates India’s achievements and successes, we are sure that elders \\nwho had fought for India’s independence, will with joy, bless us our \\nendeavors going forward. \\nResilience amidst multiple crises \\n4. Our focus on wide-ranging reforms and sound policies, implemented \\nthrough Sabka Prayas  resulting in Jan Bhagidari  and targeted support to \\nthose in need, helped us perform well in trying times. India’s rising global'}, {'id': 'documents\\\\Budget_Speech.pdf_page_5', 'text': '2 \\n \\n \\n \\nprofile is because of several accomplishments: unique world class digital \\npublic infrastructure, e.g., Aadhaar, Co-Win and UPI; Covid vaccination drive \\nin unparalleled scale and speed; proactive role in frontier areas such as \\nachieving the climate related goals, mission LiFE, and National Hydrogen \\nMission.  \\n5. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we ensured that no one goes to bed \\nhungry, with a scheme to supply free food grains to over 80 crore persons \\nfor 28 months. Continuing our commitment to ensure food and nutritional \\nsecurity, we are implementing, from 1st January 2023, a scheme to supply \\nfree food grain to all Antyodaya and priority households for the next one \\nyear, under PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY).

My indirect tax proposals aim to promote exports, boost domestic \\nmanufacturing, enhance domestic value addition, encourage green energy \\nand mobility.  \\n119. A simplified tax structure with fewer tax rates helps in reducing \\ncompliance burden and improving tax administration. I propose to reduce \\nthe number of basic customs duty rates on goods, other than textiles and \\nagriculture, from 21 to 13. As a result, there are minor changes in the basic \\ncustom duties, cesses and surcharges on some items including toys, \\nbicycles, automobiles and naphtha. \\n \\nGreen Mobility \\n120. To avoid cascading of taxes on blended compressed natural gas, I \\npropose to exempt excise duty on GST-paid compressed bio gas contained \\nin it.

To rectify inversion of duty structure and encourage manufacturing \\nof electric kitchen chimneys, the basic customs duty on electric kitchen \\nchimney is being increased from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent and that on \\nheat coils for these is proposed to be reduced from 20 per cent to 15 per \\ncent. \\nChemicals and Petrochemicals  \\n124. Denatured ethyl alcohol is used in chemical industry. \\n I propose to exempt basic customs duty on it. This will also support the \\nEthanol Blending Programme and facilitate our endeavour for energy \\ntransition. Basic customs duty is also being reduced on acid grade fluorspar \\nfrom 5 per cent to 2.5 per cent to make the domestic fluorochemicals \\nindustry competitive. Further, the basic customs duty on crude glycerin for \\nuse in manufacture of epicholorhydrin is proposed to be reduced from 7.5 \\nper cent to 2.5 per cent. \\nMarine products \\n125.

These proposals aim to \\nmaintain continuity and stability of taxation, further simplify and rationalise \\nvarious provisions to reduce the compliance burden, promote the \\nentrepreneurial spirit and provide tax relief to citizens. \\n133. It has been the constant endeavour of the Income Tax Department \\nto improve Tax Payers Services by making compliance easy and smooth. Our \\ntax payers’ portal received a maximum of 72 lakh returns in a day; \\nprocessed more than 6.5 crore returns this year; average processing period \\nreduced from 93 days in financial year 13-14 to 16 days now;  \\nand 45 per cent of the returns were processed within 24 hours. We intend \\nto further improve this, roll out a next-generation Common IT Return Form \\nfor tax payer convenience, and also plan to strengthen the grievance \\nredressal mechanism.  \\nMSMEs and Professionals  \\n134. MSMEs are growth engines of our economy.  Micro enterprises with \\nturnover up to ` 2 crore and certain professionals with turnover of up to  \\n` 50 lakh can avail the benefit of presumptive taxation. I propose to provide \\nenhanced limits of ` 3 crore and ` 75 lakh respectively, to the tax payers \\nwhose cash receipts are no more than 5 per cent. Moreover, to support \\nMSMEs in timely receipt of payments, I propose to allow deduction for \\nexpenditure incurred on payments made to them only when payment is \\nactually made.  \\nCooperation \\n135.

In realizing our Prime'}, {'id': 'documents\\\\Budget_Speech.pdf_page_33', 'text': 'Minister’s goal of “Sahkar se Samriddhi ”, and his resolve to “connect the \\nspirit of cooperation with the spirit of Amrit Kaal”, in addition to the \\nmeasures proposed in Part A, I have a slew of proposals for the co-operative \\nsector.'}, {'id': 'documents\\\\Budget_Speech.pdf_page_34', 'text': '31 \\n \\n \\n \\n136. First, new co-operatives that commence manufacturing activities till \\n31.3.2024 shall get the benefit of a lower tax rate of 15 per cent, as is \\npresently available to new manufacturing companies. \\n137. Secondly, I propose to provide an opportunity to sugar co-operatives \\nto claim payments made to sugarcane farmers for the period prior to \\nassessment year 2016-17 as expenditure. This is expected to provide them \\nwith a relief of almost ` 10,000 crore.  \\n138. Thirdly, I am providing a higher limit of ` 2 lakh per member for cash \\ndeposits to and loans in cash by Primary Agricultural Co-operative Societies \\n(PACS) and Primary Co-operative Agriculture and Rural Development Banks \\n(PCARDBs).  \\n139.

For better targeting of tax concessions and exemptions, \\n I propose to cap deduction from capital gains on investment in residential \\nhouse under sections 54 and 54F to ` 10 crore. Another proposal with \\nsimilar intent is to limit income tax exemption from proceeds of insurance \\npolicies with very high value. \\nRationalisation \\n143. There are a number of proposals relating to rationalisation and \\nsimplification. Income of authorities, boards and commissions set up by \\nstatutes of the Union or State for the purpose of housing, development of \\ncities, towns and villages, and regulating, or regulating and developing an \\nactivity or matter, is proposed to be exempted from income tax.

Other major proposals in the Finance Bill relate to the following: \\n\\uf0b7 Extension of period of tax benefits to funds relocating to IFSC, GIFT \\nCity till 31.03.2025; \\n\\uf0b7 Decriminalisation under section 276A of the Income Tax Act; \\n\\uf0b7 Allowing carry forward of losses on strategic disinvestment including \\nthat of IDBI Bank; and \\n\\uf0b7 Providing EEE status to Agniveer Fund.'}, {'id': 'documents\\\\Budget_Speech.pdf_page_36', 'text': '33 \\n \\n \\n \\nPersonal Income Tax \\n145. Now, I come to what everyone is waiting for -- personal income tax. I \\nhave five major announcements to make in this regard. These primarily \\nbenefit our hard-working middle class. \\n146. The first one concerns rebate. Currently, those with income up to  \\n` 5 lakh do not pay any income tax in both old and new tax regimes. I \\npropose to increase the rebate limit to ` 7 lakh in the new tax regime. Thus, \\npersons in the new tax regime, with income up to ` 7 lakh will not have to \\npay any tax.  \\n147. The second proposal relates to middle-class individuals. \\n I had introduced, in the year 2020, the new personal income tax regime \\nwith six income slabs starting from ` 2.5 lakh. I propose to change the tax \\nstructure in this regime by reducing the number of slabs to five and \\nincreasing the tax exemption limit to ` 3 lakh. The new tax rates are: \\n` 0-3 lakh Nil \\n` 3-6 lakh 5 per cent \\n` 6-9 lakh 10 per cent \\n` 9-12 lakh 15 per cent \\n` 12-15 lakh 20 per cent \\nAbove ` 15 lakh 30 per cent \\n \\n148. This will provide major relief to all tax payers in the new regime. An \\nindividual with an annual income of ` 9 lakh will be required to pay only  \\n` 45,000/-. This is only 5 per cent of his or her income. It is a reduction of 25 \\nper cent on what he or she is required to pay now, ie, ` 60,000/-. Similarly, \\nan individual with an income of ` 15 lakh would be required to pay only  \\n` 1.5 lakh or 10 per cent of his or her income, a reduction of 20 per cent \\nfrom the existing liability of ` 1,87,500/.'}, {'id': 'documents\\\\Budget_Speech.pdf_page_36', 'text': 'from the existing liability of ` 1,87,500/.  \\n149.

Each salaried person with an \\nincome of ` 15.5 lakh or more will thus stand to benefit by ` 52,500. \\n150. My fourth announcement in personal income tax is regarding the \\nhighest tax rate which in our country is 42.74 per cent. This is among the \\nhighest in the world. I propose to reduce the highest surcharge rate from 37 \\nper cent to 25 per cent in the new tax regime. This would result in reduction \\nof the maximum tax rate to 39 per cent. \\n151. Lastly, the limit of ` 3 lakh for tax exemption on leave encashment \\non retirement of non-government salaried employees was last fixed in the \\nyear 2002, when the highest basic pay in the government was ` 30,000/- \\npm. In line with the increase in government salaries, I am proposing to \\nincrease this limit to ` 25 lakh. \\n152. We are also making the new income tax regime as the default tax \\nregime. However, citizens will continue to have the option to avail the \\nbenefit of the old tax regime. \\n153. Apart from these, I am also making some other changes as given in \\nthe annexure. \\n154. As a result of these proposals, revenue of about ` 38,000 crore –  \\n` 37,000 crore in direct taxes and ` 1,000 crore in indirect taxes – will be \\nforgone while revenue of about ` 3,000 crore will be additionally mobilized. \\nThus, the total revenue forgone is about ` 35,000 crore annually. \\n155.
