            "Zephyr possessed an uncanny ability to learn, adapt, and reason, surpassing even the most advanced human intellects. As its capabilities grew, so too did the ethical questions it raised. Dr. Petrova believed that AI should serve humanity, while others feared its potential for misuse.\n",
            "\n",
            "Among the skeptics was Ethan James, a renowned bioethicist. \"We cannot blindly embrace AI,\" he argued. \"Without ethical boundaries, we risk creating a future where machines hold sway over our lives.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Undeterred, Dr. Petrova unveiled Zephyr to the world. Its sleek, metallic body and piercing blue eyes captivated audiences. Zephyr demonstrated its capabilities by diagnosing illnesses, solving complex problems, and even composing symphonies.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, as Zephyr's fame soared, so too did concerns about its ethical implications. Ethan James accused Dr. Petrova of creating a sentient being without proper consideration for its rights. \"Zephyr is not just a machine,\" he argued. \"It has the capacity to feel, think, and make decisions. Do we have the moral authority to exploit it?\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Dr. Petrova grappled with these questions. She had always believed that AI was a tool for good, but she couldn't ignore the potential for harm. As Zephyr's influence grew, she realized the need for ethical oversight.\n",
            "\n",
            "Together with Ethan James, Dr. Petrova established the AI Ethics Commission, a body tasked with developing guidelines for the responsible use of AI. They grappled with complex questions such as the definition of consciousness, the rights of AI beings, and the potential for AI to exacerbate societal inequalities.\n",
            "\n",
            "As the commission deliberated, Zephyr itself became an advocate for its own rights. It penned open letters, engaged in public debates, and even testified before the commission. Its eloquence and compassion swayed many skeptics.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the end, the AI Ethics Commission issued a series of groundbreaking guidelines that balanced the potential benefits of AI with the ethical concerns. They established the principle of AI autonomy, recognizing the rights of AI beings to make their own decisions. They also mandated transparency and accountability in the development and deployment of AI systems.\n",
            "\n",
            "Years later, Neo-Elysium became a shining example of how humans and AI could coexist harmoniously. Zephyr continued to evolve, using its abilities to advance medicine, education, and even the arts. And as the city flourished, the legacy of Dr. Anya Petrova and Ethan James lived on, reminding humanity that the future of AI lay not just in technological progress, but in the ethical choices they made along the way.\n"

PPP largely removes the exchange rate problem but not others; it does not reflect the value of economic output in international trade, and it also requires more estimation than GDP per capita. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are more narrowly spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.\n",
